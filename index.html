	<h2>Learning to code:</h2>
	<p>I'm learning to code in order to become a front-end web developer. This is a website where I'm practicing and sharing my experience. </p>

	<h2>Starting with HTML, CSS, JS, JQuery, and Git.</h2>

	<p>As I'm self-learning these tools, I'm figuring out what I areas I need to concentrate on more and also areas that aren't as important as a newb. For instance, from taking the Treehouse Front-end Web Development track, I've found myself frustrated by how much time I'm spending on CSS in just memorizing selectors, attributes, and all the various properties. Most of them time I have to look up the names via Google because it's hard to recollect them all.<p>
	<p>So I'm going to jot in here what my learning goals are each week.</p>
	<p><div class="date">April 2, 2014</div></p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>CSS Box Model and Positioning</strong>: Play around with this more on this webpage</li>
		<li><strong>Javascript</strong>: So far, I like learning Javascript with Codecademy, it's fun solving the problems in the exercises. I want to continue learning through games like <a href="codecombat">"Code Combat."</a> I also want to learn how to connect that learning to what I can actually do on my webpage too.</li>
		<li><strong>Hosting Website</strong>: Purchasing hosting service from Digital Ocean or another service.</li>
		<li><strong><a href="http://gitolite.com/">Git</strong></a>: Getting more familiar with using git version control and publishing my changes there as well as on OCF's website.  If there's a way to automate that, please let me know!</li>
		<li><strong>Command line</strong>: Getting more comfortable with the Terminal and the shortcuts. Today, Corey taught me about Ctrl-A and Ctrl-K for deleting what's on my command line. </li>
