			<h2>My Goal: Become a front-end web developer.</h2>
		
			<p>My strategy is to teach myself front-end web development and create a portfolio.</p>

		
			<h2>Starting with HTML, CSS and Git.</h2>

			<p>As I'm learning, I'm figuring out what I areas I need to concentrate on more and also areas that aren't as important.

			For instance, I've noticed that I'm getting distracted with Treehouse Front-end Web Development track. I've found myself frustrated by how much time I'm spending on CSS in just memorizing selectors, attributes, and all the various properties. Most of them time I have to look up the names via Google because it's hard to recollect them all.<p>

			<p> I'm also making my web pages overly complicated right now. So I'm starting back at square one and not playing around with too many properties.</p>
		
			<p>So I'm going to jot in here what my learning goals are each week.</p>
			
			<p><div class="date">April 4, 2014</div></p>
			<p>Starting back at HTML in Treehouse to double-check that I understand everything that's happening on the website. I initially skipped this section because the videos felt so slow and basic. But since I'm facing some issues with this site, I think it's good to refresh and learn best practices.
			</p>
			<p> I've already seen some issues in my CSS where I placed the container class around the wrong blocks of content. I also need to pay attention to parent elements and specificity.
			</p>

			<p><div class="date">April 2, 2014</div></p>

			<p>Today, I worked on using git version control, moving around boxes of content on this site, trying out alignment, transparencies and more. Still need to figure out an issue with the "Resource" section. Trying to add a border to it. </p>
		
			<ul>
				<li><strong>CSS Box Model and Positioning</strong>: Play around with this more on this webpage</li>
				<li><strong>Javascript</strong>: So far, I like learning Javascript with Codecademy, it's fun solving the problems in the exercises. I want to continue learning through games like <a href="codecombat">"Code Combat."</a> I also want to learn how to connect that learning to what I can actually do on my webpage too.</li>
				<li><strong>Hosting Website</strong>: Purchasing hosting service from Digital Ocean or another service.</li>
				<li><strong><a href="http://gitolite.com/">Git</strong></a>: Getting more familiar with using git version control and publishing my changes there as well as on OCF's website.  If there's a way to automate that, please let me know!</li>
				<li><strong>Command line</strong>: Getting more comfortable with the Terminal and the shortcuts. Today, Corey taught me about Ctrl-A and Ctrl-K for deleting what's on my command line. </li>
